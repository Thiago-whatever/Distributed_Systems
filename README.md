# Distributed Systems - Course Projects

This repository contains all the projects carried out during the Distributed Systems course, taught by Dr. J. Octavio Gutiérrez García at ITAM.

## Presentation

The Distributed Systems course is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of the principles and techniques used in building systems whose components are distributed across a network. Over the course I learned to design, implement, and manage distributed systems, understand the challenges and leverage the most advanced technologies.

## Introduction

The course aims to equip students with the skills needed to design and implement distributed systems. It covers the existing technologies for implementing distributed systems, methods of communication between distributed processes, and the development of web applications and services. The course also delves into concurrency mechanisms in distributed processes.

## Course Objectives

- Design and implement distributed systems.
- Understand and manage existing technologies for implementing distributed systems.
- Implement communication methods between distributed processes.
- Develop web applications and services.
- Implement concurrency mechanisms between distributed processes.
